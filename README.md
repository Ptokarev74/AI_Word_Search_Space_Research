Wordle AI Solver

This repository presents a research project exploring AI strategies for solving Wordle, the popular word puzzle game. The work investigates how different algorithmic approaches, ranging from rule-based filtering to information-theoretic methods, impact solver efficiency and accuracy.

Research Goal

Wordle is a constrained problem in search, optimization, and information theory. Each guess reduces uncertainty about the hidden target word, creating a setting to test algorithms that balance exploration (gathering information) and reducing the search space (narrowing down candidate words).

The research questions are:
How do heuristic, frequency-based, and entropy-based approaches compare in performance?
What trade-offs exist between computational complexity and solution efficiency?
Can Wordle serve as a testbed for broader ideas in decision-making under uncertainty?

Methods

Three solver variants were implemented in Python:

Rule-Based Solver eliminates words inconsistent with feedback, representing a baseline logical approach.

Frequency-Based Solver, ranks candidate guesses by letter frequency across the word list, prioritizing guesses that cover high-information letters.

Entropy-Based Solver, calculates expected information gain for each guess and selects the word that minimizes entropy in the remaining solution space.

Experimental Setup

Word List: Derived from official Wordle dictionaries (solution + allowed guess sets).
Evaluation Metric: Average number of guesses required to find the solution.
Tools: Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib (experiments conducted in Jupyter/Colab).

Results & Findings
Solver Type	Avg. Guesses	Strengths	Limitations
Rule-Based	~4.3	Simple, fast	Suboptimal, lacks global strategy
Frequency-Based	~3.9	Strong early narrowing	Can plateau on ambiguous words
Entropy-Based	~3.6	Most efficient	Computationally expensive

Key Insights:

Information-theoretic strategies outperform simpler heuristics, but at a higher computational cost.
Wordle reflects a balance between greedy optimization and global search efficiency.
Entropy-based methods provide a strong foundation for extensions to more complex word or sequence-based puzzles.
